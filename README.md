# K3s Homelab

Three-node Kubernetes homelab running on physical HP T630 machines. All nodes are k3s servers, control-plane nodes, etcd members and workload nodes.

## Hardware

| Node      | Address         | Roles                          | Hardware                      |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `master`  | `192.168.55.10` | control-plane, etcd, workloads | HP T630, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD |
| `worker1` | `192.168.55.11` | control-plane, etcd, workloads | HP T630, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD |
| `worker2` | `192.168.55.12` | control-plane, etcd, workloads | HP T630, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD |

The node names are historical. `master`, `worker1` and `worker2` have the same Kubernetes roles.

HAProxy runs in an LXC container on the Proxmox server and uses `192.168.0.45`.

## Traffic paths

Kubernetes API:

```text
kubectl
→ HAProxy:6443
→ one of the three k3s API servers
```

Application traffic:

```text
client
→ HAProxy:80/443
→ node:80/443
→ K3s ServiceLB / klipper-lb
→ Service/traefik
→ Traefik Pod
→ application Pod
```

HAProxy forwards API and HTTPS traffic in TCP mode. Traefik terminates application TLS and performs HTTP routing.

## Network state

```text
Node network: 192.168.55.0/24
Service CIDR: 10.43.0.0/16
Pod CIDR:     10.42.0.0/16
```

Cilium uses Kubernetes IPAM:

```text
ipam=kubernetes
k8s-require-ipv4-pod-cidr=true
routing=VXLAN
kubeProxyReplacement=false
```

Each node receives its own `/24` PodCIDR from k3s:

```text
master:  10.42.0.0/24
worker1: 10.42.1.0/24
worker2: 10.42.2.0/24
```

Flux is the source of truth for Kubernetes resources managed by the repository. Ansible owns host-level configuration. Built-in k3s components remain managed by k3s unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The files above describe the current state. Migration history, incidents and experiments are kept in the [journal](../journal/).

Each Kubernetes learning session produces a Polish journal entry. A reusable failure
and its verified solution may also become a troubleshooting article. The state
documentation is updated only when the current architecture or operating procedure
changes.
